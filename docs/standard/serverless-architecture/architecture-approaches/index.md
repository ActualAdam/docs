# Architecture approaches

Understanding existing approaches to architecting enterprise apps helps clarify the role played by serverless. There are many approaches and patterns that evolved over decades of software development, and all have their own pros and cons. In many cases, the ultimate solution may not involve deciding on a single approach but may integrate several solutions. Migration scenarios often involve shifting from one architecture approach to another through a hybrid approach.

This chapter provides an overview of both logical and physical architecture patterns for enterprise applications.
